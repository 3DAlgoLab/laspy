Laspy Tools
===========

Laspy comes with several command line utilities which use the library. In the 
laspy/tools directory, you should find lascopy.py and file_verify.py. These 
are the two full utilites provided by laspy at the moment. 

**lascopy**

Lascopy aims to be a general purpose LAS file version and point format conversion
tool, and is able to read and write between all valid combinations of these two
values. If the output data format has fewer dimensions than the input data set, 
the output file will not include them.

**lasverify**
